function [ ik_sol ] = puma_ik( x, y, z, R )
%PUMA_IK Write your code here. The input to the function will be the position of
%    the end effector (in inches) in the world frame, and the 
%    Rotation matrix R_60 as described in part 2.
%    The output must be the joint angles of the robot to achieve 
%    the desired end effector position and orientation.
